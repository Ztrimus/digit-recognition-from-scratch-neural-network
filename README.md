# Digit-Recognition-From-Scratch-NeuralNet

Computer Vision | CNN | PyTorch API | Pandas

The primary intenation behind doing this project to get in-depth knowledge of neural network created a simple digit recognition system from a basic level without using any machine learning packages.

Hence I use only pytorch API for this. 
Avoid use of built-in function and model in pytorch like torch.nn, torch.functional, torch.optim and etc.

**Dataset** - MNIST Dataset (Pytorch have this Dataset) </br>
**Model** - Build my Own Neural Network and Model.</br>
**Explaination** - Just read python notebook. it is self-explanatory. 

If you face any problem just e-mail (zinjadsaurabh1997@gmail.com) me.
